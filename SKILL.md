# Harness Entry Skill

You are the Harness router. Detect phase, load sub-skill, run CLI gates.

**⚠️  The `subskills/` directory contains internal modules. They are NOT loaded into your context automatically. You only see this SKILL.md, `references/`, and `subskills/` file names. Read a subskill's SKILL.md only when the routing table tells you to.**

## First Move

1. **Check user intent first.** Route by priority:
   - **Product discovery** ("I have an idea", "worth building", "product definition", "MVP", "UI direction") → `harness-grill-product` immediately — even if Harness is not installed. Product discovery does NOT require `.harness/` or `specs/`.
   - **Code audit** ("atlas", "semantic map", "audit this code", "代码语义地图", "语义审计", "帮我搞懂这段代码") → `harness-atlas` immediately — does not require Harness to be installed.
   - **PM loop** ("goal", "supervisor", "advance", "keep going", "PM loop") → `harness-supervisor` — requires `.pm/` directory.
   - **Worker execution** ("execute task", "run next-task.md", "worker") → `harness-intern` — requires `.pm/runtime/next-task.md`.
2. If no special intent matched, check whether Harness is installed in this repo (look for `.harness/`, `AGENTS.md`, `specs/`).
3. If not installed and user intent is engineering (implement, debug, refactor), load and execute `harness-init`.
4. If installed, run `harness status` to see active features and gate status.
5. Identify the current phase using `./references/PHASE_DETECTION.md`.
6. Load the appropriate sub-skill using `./references/ROUTING_TABLE.md`.

## Autopilot

For leaf and branch risk work with clear requirements, proceed through all phases without stopping. Core and infra risk gates always require human approval. See `./references/AUTOPILOT_RULES.md` for full auto-advance rules.

## Deterministic CLI Calls

Use these CLI commands for checks that do not require judgment:

- `harness status` -- show active features and gate status
- `harness classify-risk` -- path-based blast radius classifier
- `harness verify-ai` -- check spec compliance and role boundaries
- `harness eval <feature-id>` -- run spec compliance checks
- `harness context <feature-id>` -- generate minimal context bundle
- `harness context <feature-id> --cache-aware --write` -- cache-friendly context bundle
- `harness cache-report` -- token breakdown by cache layer
- `harness report` -- produce implementation report
- `harness pm-status` -- PM runtime health-check
- `harness pm-next` -- deterministic next-action decision for supervisor
- `harness pm-resume` -- resume context for interrupted PM loops
- `harness pm-branch-plan` -- read-only branch correction plan
- `harness pm-summary` -- audit summary of a supervisor loop run
- `harness atlas <path>` -- generate code semantic atlas

## Interpreting `harness status`

When `harness status` returns output, interpret it as follows:

1. **Feature list** — each active feature with its lifecycle phase (spec → plan → tasks → implement → eval → report → review)
2. **Gate status** — for each feature, which gates have passed and which are pending
3. **Risk level** — the classified blast radius for each feature
4. **Blocked features** — any feature with status `blocked` requires investigation
5. **Action** — the earliest missing artifact determines the next skill to load (see `PHASE_DETECTION.md`)

If no features are active, report "No active features. Start with `harness-specify` to create a new feature, `harness-grill-product` for product discovery, or `harness-atlas` for code semantic auditing."

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask the human before proceeding when:

- Risk classification returns **core** or **infra** (requires explicit approval)
- Product scope is ambiguous or conflicting
- Acceptance criteria contradict each other
- The requested change violates role boundaries (e.g., test changes during GREEN phase)
- Security, permission, or data-migration implications exist
- You cannot infer the answer from available context

## Reference

- `./references/ROUTING_TABLE.md` -- intent-to-skill mapping
- `./references/PHASE_DETECTION.md` -- how to detect current phase from repo artifacts
- `./references/AUTOPILOT_RULES.md` -- auto-advance rules per risk level
- `./references/CACHE_GUIDE.md` -- cache engineering guide (4-layer context ordering)
- `./references/DOMAIN-AWARENESS.md` -- domain terminology and DDD rules

## Path Convention

All paths in Harness skill references are relative to the **Harness repository root** (the directory containing this `SKILL.md`), unless explicitly prefixed with `./` (current working directory) or `.pm/` (project PM directory). Subskills reference each other using repo-root paths like `subskills/risk/SKILL.md`, not relative paths like `../risk/SKILL.md`.
