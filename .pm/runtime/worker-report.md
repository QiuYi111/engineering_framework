# Worker Report

## Task summary

Replace supervisor delegation/review protocol with tested slash-command OpenCode invocations and add Makefile entrypoints for PM runtime verification.

## What was done

- **Updated**: `.pm/runtime/worker-config.yaml`
  - Changed sync delegation command from `--agent build -f ... 'Act as harness-intern...'` to `/harness-intern` slash command via `opencode run`

- **Updated**: `references/templates/pm/worker-config.yaml`
  - Changed template command from `--agent harness-intern --file` to `/harness-intern` slash command matching runtime config

- **Updated**: `subskills/supervisor/references/loop-steps.md`
  - Step 5: Replaced `--agent harness-intern` and "Act as harness-intern" patterns with canonical `/harness-intern` slash command. Added explicit instruction to NOT use `--agent` or natural-language role-play.
  - Step 6: Added mandatory independent review via `/harness review` for branch+ risk or material claims. Added guidance to spawn multiple independent review agents in parallel for separable questions.

- **Updated**: `.pm/decisions.md`
  - Added decision: Slash-command delegation (`/harness-intern` via OpenCode CLI)
  - Added decision: Independent review agents for branch+ risk
  - Added decision: Commit taxonomy (product, pm-ledger, checkpoint with `[prefix]` convention)

- **Created**: `Makefile`
  - `test`: wraps `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v`
  - `verify-ai`: wraps `uv run harness verify-ai`
  - `pm-status`: wraps `uv run harness pm-status`
  - `pm-next`: wraps `uv run harness pm-next`
  - `pm-resume`: wraps `uv run harness pm-resume`
  - `verify`: runs both `verify-ai` and `pm-status`
  - `help`: self-documenting target listing

## Changed files

- `.pm/runtime/worker-config.yaml`
- `references/templates/pm/worker-config.yaml`
- `subskills/supervisor/references/loop-steps.md`
- `.pm/decisions.md`
- `Makefile`

## Test results

57 tests pass (no new tests needed — this is a config/doc/Makefile task). All pre-existing tests continue to pass.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Worker config and template use `/harness-intern ...` slash-command delegation
- [x] Supervisor loop docs no longer recommend `--agent harness-intern` or "Act as harness-intern" delegation
- [x] Supervisor review docs require independent `/harness review ...` review for branch+ or material claims and mention parallel independent reviewers for separable review questions
- [x] `.pm/decisions.md` records slash delegation, reviewer-agent, and commit-taxonomy decisions
- [x] Root Makefile exists and `make test`, `make verify-ai`, `make pm-status`, `make pm-next`, `make pm-resume`, and `make verify` work
- [x] Pre-existing dirty files listed in forbidden scope are not modified or staged by this task
- [x] One clear git commit is created for this task only

## Problems encountered

None.

## Deviations

None. All changes stayed within allowed scope. Forbidden files (`verify.py`, `opencode-cli/SKILL.md`, `opencode-cli/references/patterns.md`) were not modified. No `.pm/stable/*` files were touched.

## Rework (supervisor review findings)

Two issues were identified by the supervisor review:

### Fix 1: `/review` → `/harness review` in loop-steps.md

**File**: `subskills/supervisor/references/loop-steps.md` line 140

**Problem**: The code block under "Independent review via `/harness review`" used `opencode run "/review ..."` instead of `opencode run "/harness review ..."`. This contradicts the decision recorded in `.pm/decisions.md` (which says `/harness review`) and the task requirement.

**Fix**: Changed `/review` to `/harness review` in the code block.

### Fix 2: Makefile `verify` target missing `test`

**File**: `Makefile` line 21

**Problem**: The `verify` target depended only on `verify-ai pm-status`, but the task requirement and the decisions say verify should be a real project gate including tests.

**Fix**: Added `test` as a dependency: `verify: test verify-ai pm-status`.

### Rework verification

- `make test` → 57 passed
- `make verify-ai` → 47/0/1
- `make pm-status` → valid
- `make verify` → all three pass (test + verify-ai + pm-status)
- Forbidden files unchanged (pre-existing diffs only)
- `.pm/decisions.md` not modified (decisions already correct)
- `.pm/stable/*` not touched

## Evidence

- Branch: `codex/dogfood` (branch-policy ok)
- All 6 Makefile targets exit 0
- 57/57 tests pass
- `harness verify-ai` passes (47/0/1)
- Forbidden files show pre-existing diffs only, none staged
- Rework commit created separately from original task commit
