# Loop Log

Append-only log. Each supervisor iteration adds one entry.

## Iteration 0

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: product_definition
- Summary: Product contract frozen for Harness dogfood `/goal` long-running supervisor loop.
- Decision: MVP requires `/goal` long run, with bounded `max_iterations: 5` validation before unbounded mode.
- Next action: delegate first feasibility task.

## Supervisor Delegation 1

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: waiting_for_worker
- Branch: codex/dogfood
- Summary: Wrote first bounded feasibility task for deterministic PM runtime health check.
- Worker mode: sync OpenCode
- Forbidden scope: pre-existing `scripts/harness_runtime/verify.py` change, `.pm/stable/*`, product boundary changes

## Supervisor Review 1

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: needs_rework
- Worker commit: 6125f40
- Verdict: rejected
- Evidence: pm-status passed, unittest 18/18 passed, verify-ai passed
- Rejection reason: loop-control classifier accepts `USER_DECISION` but not protocol values `NEEDS_USER_DECISION`, `BLOCKED`, and `STAGE_EXIT_REACHED`
- Next action: request bounded rework

## Supervisor Review 1 Rework

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: ready_to_delegate
- Worker commit: 07d4af8
- Verdict: accepted
- Evidence: pm-status passed, unittest 21/21 passed, verify-ai passed, direct protocol check passed
- Accepted result: PM runtime health-check foundation and `harness pm-status` are available
- Iteration valid count: 1
- Iteration total count: 1
- Next action: delegate next feasibility task

## Supervisor Delegation 2

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: waiting_for_worker
- Branch: codex/dogfood
- Summary: Wrote second bounded feasibility task to strengthen worker-report validation
- Worker mode: sync OpenCode
- Forbidden scope: pre-existing `scripts/harness_runtime/verify.py` change, `.pm/stable/*`, product boundary changes

## Supervisor Review 2

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: ready_to_delegate
- Worker commit: 8cfc1e6
- Verdict: accepted
- Evidence: pm-status passed, unittest 25/25 passed, verify-ai passed, worker report validator returned valid
- Accepted result: deterministic worker-report validation now reports missing sections
- Iteration valid count: 2
- Iteration total count: 2
- Next action: delegate next feasibility task
