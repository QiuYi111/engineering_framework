# Loop Log

Append-only log. Each supervisor iteration adds one entry.

## Iteration 0

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: product_definition
- Summary: Product contract frozen for Harness dogfood `/goal` long-running supervisor loop.
- Decision: MVP requires `/goal` long run, with bounded `max_iterations: 5` validation before unbounded mode.
- Next action: delegate first feasibility task.

## Supervisor Delegation 1

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: waiting_for_worker
- Branch: codex/dogfood
- Summary: Wrote first bounded feasibility task for deterministic PM runtime health check.
- Worker mode: sync OpenCode

## Supervisor Review 1

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: needs_rework
- Worker commit: 6125f40
- Verdict: rejected
- Evidence: pm-status passed, unittest 18/18 passed, verify-ai passed
- Rejection reason: loop-control classifier accepts `USER_DECISION` but not protocol values `NEEDS_USER_DECISION`, `BLOCKED`, and `STAGE_EXIT_REACHED`

- Verdict: accepted with process warning
- Evidence: pm-next passed, pm-status passed, unittest 39/39 passed, verify-ai passed, worker report validator returned valid
- Accepted result: deterministic `pm-next` decision helper is available
- Process warning: worker committed on `main`; supervisor fast-forwarded `codex/dogfood` to include the commit and switched back
- Iteration valid count: 3
- Iteration total count: 3
- Next action: delegate branch-policy enforcement task

## Supervisor Delegation 4

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: waiting_for_worker
- Branch: codex/dogfood
- Summary: Wrote fourth bounded feasibility task for read-only branch-policy validation
- Worker mode: sync OpenCode
- Forbidden scope: pre-existing `scripts/harness_runtime/verify.py` change, `.pm/stable/*`, product boundary changes, git branch mutation

## Supervisor Review 4

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: ready_to_delegate
- Worker commit: df9f58e
- Verdict: accepted
- Evidence: pm-status passed with branch policy ok, pm-next passed, unittest 47/47 passed, verify-ai passed, mismatch simulation blocked
- Accepted result: branch-policy validation is available in `pm-status` and `pm-next`
- Iteration valid count: 4
- Iteration total count: 4
- Next action: delegate resume-context support task

## Supervisor Delegation 5

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: waiting_for_worker
- Branch: codex/dogfood
- Summary: Wrote fifth bounded feasibility task for deterministic resume-context support
- Worker mode: sync OpenCode
- Forbidden scope: pre-existing `scripts/harness_runtime/verify.py` change, `.pm/stable/*`, product boundary changes

## Supervisor Review 5

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: stage_exit_reached
- Worker commit: b8aab4e
- Verdict: accepted
- Evidence: pm-resume passed, pm-status passed, pm-next passed, unittest 57/57 passed, verify-ai passed, worker report validator returned valid
- Accepted result: deterministic `pm-resume` context helper is available
- Iteration valid count: 5
- Iteration total count: 5
- Stage result: bounded feasibility validation passed 5/5
- Next action: stop at Stage 1 exit before unbounded `/goal` mode

## Supervisor Delegation 6

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: worker_running
- Branch: codex/dogfood
- Summary: Wrote Stage 2 slash-command protocol hardening task after user approved continued dogfood.
- Worker mode: sync OpenCode via `/harness-intern`
- PM ledger commit: 82f596f
- Forbidden scope: pre-existing `scripts/harness_runtime/verify.py`, `subskills/opencode-cli/SKILL.md`, `subskills/opencode-cli/references/patterns.md`, `.pm/stable/*`

## Supervisor Review 6

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: ready_to_delegate
- Worker commits: 88302a4, a5d15b5
- Verdict: accepted after rework
- Rework reason: initial review command example used `/review` instead of `/harness review`, and Makefile `verify` omitted `test`
- Independent reviewers: 3 parallel read-only `/harness review` agents, all pass
- Evidence: make verify passed, make pm-next delegate, make pm-resume ok, worker report validator returned valid
- Accepted result: slash-command delegation, independent review guidance, commit taxonomy, and Makefile entrypoints are in place
- Iteration valid count: 6
- Iteration total count: 6
- Next action: continue Stage 2 dogfood with another bounded improvement task

## Supervisor Delegation 7

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: worker_running
- Branch: codex/dogfood
- Summary: Wrote bounded task for read-only branch correction plan helper to help supervisor recover from branch drift.
- Worker mode: sync OpenCode via `/harness-intern`
- PM ledger commit: 5f607d0
- Forbidden scope: pre-existing `scripts/harness_runtime/verify.py`, `subskills/opencode-cli/SKILL.md`, `subskills/opencode-cli/references/patterns.md`, `.pm/stable/*`, git mutation commands

## Supervisor Review 7

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Phase: ready_to_delegate
- Worker commit: 659c499
- Verdict: accepted
- Evidence: 65/65 tests passed, pm-branch-plan correctly reports `manual_review_required` for diverged branches, make verify passed, worker report validator returned valid
- Accepted result: read-only branch correction plan helper is available via `harness pm-branch-plan`
- Branch note: `main` and `codex/dogfood` diverged post-task due to identical "update" commits on both branches; `pm-branch-plan` correctly detects this
- Iteration valid count: 7
- Iteration total count: 7
- Next action: continue Stage 2 dogfood with next bounded improvement task
